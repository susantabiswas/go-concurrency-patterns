# Concurrency patterns in Go

Go is a great language to write concurrency code. The language is designed in a way to make doing this very simple with high level abstractions.

Go offers **channels**, **for-select**, **go routines** and a few others language constructs to make writing concurrent code easier. It does offer other low level constructs like mutex etc., in `sync` package.

I have written some of the popular concurrency patterns here in this repo.
